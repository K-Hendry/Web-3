    <p>Hey! I’m Kelsey and I’m a graphic designer from Philadelphia. I am currently an undergraduate at Drexel University, where I study graphic design and minors in communications and fine art. I have experience in branding, social media marketing, logo design, publication and poster design, as well as some background in HTML and CSS. In my free time I can be found wandering with my camera, looking for my next shot, or hanging out with my dog, Penny. I have a strong background in communications and writing and I love working with clients to achieve a product we can both feel proud of. </p>
